Make and Makefiles - exercise 2
--------------------------------

a) Use the source files in this directory and craft a Makefile that
satisfies the following dependency graph:

               + data.o --- +  data.c  
               |             \ 
               |              + data.h
               |             /
excer2.exe --- + main.o --- + main.c
               |             \ 
               |              + io.h
               |             /
               +  io.o  --- +

This time, you should make use of the built-in rules, to remove as many
redundant parts in your Makefile as possible.  You can either start with
the Makefile from exercise 1, and do the necessary changes, or start
with a new Makefile from scratch.

In the end, your Makefile should contain at least:

    - an OBJECT macro that lists all the .o files
    - a CFLAGS macro, that defines the compiler flags '-g -O3'
    - the CC macro, so you can easily switch compiler

- Run 'make' and verify that the code compiles correctly.  
- Try to run 'make -r'?  What happens?  Why?
- Run make with the compiler flags '-g -O2' _without_ changing the
  Makefile.  How can you achieve that?
