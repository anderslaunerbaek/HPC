Make and Makefiles - exercise 3
-------------------------------

Re-use the files from exercise 2 by copying them into this directory.

Remove all the dependency lines, i.e.

main.o: main.c data.h io.h
data.o: ...
...

from your Makefile.

- Run the 'makedepend *.c' command.  What happens to your Makefile?  
- Read the man-pages of 'makedepend' to find a way to get rid of external
  dependcies, i.e. references to file like /usr/include/stdio.h, etc.
  Note:  ignore the warnings, if there are related to external files.
- Re-run makedepend with the new options.  Look at the Makefile.
- Note:  makedepend is part of the X11 software tools, and thus not
  always installed on all systems!  An alternative in this case can be
  the C compiler.  Try to find out, if both cc and gcc can help you,
  in case makedepend is missing on your system.

Note:  If you are using the compiler to generate dependencies, they
       are not added automatically to your Makefile
