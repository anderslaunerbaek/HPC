Make and Makefiles - exercise 4
-------------------------------

Use the files in this directory to check, if the version of make you
are calling supports Fortran 90 source files (suffix .f90).  If it does,
check with the 'gmake' command.

If 'gmake' fails, extend the suffix list and write a new rule to be able
to compile the project with gmake.
